# ScintillaClass4
(AHK) Scintilla class based on [kczx3's class script](https://github.com/kczx3/Scintilla).  Working in AHK v2-a116.  Requires `Scintilla.dll` v4.4.3 or compatible.

Of course please note that other versions of scintilla.dll may or may not work, depending on differences/changes.

Examples have also been reworked to restore original functionality.
